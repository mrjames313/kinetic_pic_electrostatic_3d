# kinetic electrostatic particle in cell plasma simulation in 3D

This simulation models both electrons and ions in a 3d box.

This video shows an electron cloud starting in one corner and propagating through 
the box.  All box faces are neutral, but reflect particles specularly.  The model 
includes charges and fields created by the electrons as well as (unshown) oxygen
ions (+1).  It does not model current created by electron motion.
