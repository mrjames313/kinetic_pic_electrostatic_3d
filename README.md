# kinetic electrostatic particle in cell plasma simulation in 3D

This simulation models both electrons and ions in a 3d box.

This video shows a collection of electrons initially positioned in one corner and propagating through 
the box over a period of 2 microseconds (2e-6 seconds). 

All box faces are neutral, but reflect particles specularly.  The model 
includes charges and fields created by the charge of electrons as well as (unshown) oxygen
ions (+1).
